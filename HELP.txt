PipDash™ User Operations Pamphlet

Version 1.3.1 – For Internal Vault Use Only

Congratulations, Citizen! You are now the proud operator of the PipDash™ System Monitoring Console — the last word in atomic-age performance dashboards. With PipDash, you’ll never again wonder what your computer is doing while you type that next world-saving memo.

INSTRUCTIONS : 
1: Open APP and hit "START"

INTERPRETATING DATA
- Gauges : CPU / GPU / RAM Usage Displayed. 

- Storage Bars :  How much data you're hoarding on your machine. 

- Network Traffic : This moving plot displays network activity, UP spikes is data upload and DOWN spikes is data download. 

- System Event Ticker: This ticker will display any ERROR / WARNING / CRITICAL system log entries within the last 2 hours. Any ERROR or CRITICAL entries within the last 1 hour will enable RED ALERT MODE. To investigate these log entries further, goto your windows EVENT VIEWER and navigate to "WINDOWS LOGS/SYSTEM"

***SAFETY REMINDER***
1: Do not taunt the PiPDash.
2: Do not lick the gauges.
3: Do not attempt to install on a typewriter.

At PipDash™, your system health is our business. And remember:
“If the gauges are spinning, then so are we — toward a brighter tomorrow!”
